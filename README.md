Efficiency Data Files and Fitting Program for CAPSS 2023
Tom Sonley

FitEfficiency.py is a python3 program that reads in a .csv file, then plots the efficiency data and performs a number of fit methods to interpolate the data. 

For this exercise: 
1) Change the pandas.read_csv() command to read in the file of your choice. 
2) Modify the Polynomial Fit section to try to get a good fit in the region of your gamma ray energy, then evaulte it at your energy. 
3) Try out the Linear Interpolation and Spline Fitting methods to choose your best estimate of the efficiency value at your energy.
